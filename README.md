# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Models: A Comparative Study
This project applies and compares four different machine learning models to predict future stock prices. It was completed as part of the Machine Learning for Finance coursework.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict stock closing prices using five years of historical data for selected stocks. The models used are Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Feedforward Neural Networks. Features like moving averages, RSI, volatility, and lagged prices were engineered to improve prediction accuracy. Model performance was evaluated using MSE, MAE, and RÂ², and results were compared to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were also applied to improve model robustness.

# Technologies and Libraries Used
This project is implemented in Python using Pandas, NumPy, yFinance, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow Keras.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models.ipynb step by step
